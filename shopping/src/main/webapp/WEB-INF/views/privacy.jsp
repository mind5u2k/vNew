							Privacy can simply be defined as the right to be left alone OR
							ability of an individual to stop information about self from
							being known to people other than they choose to give. Right to
							Privacy may not be absolute in certain cases where it is
							collected by governments and as per law of the land for National
							Identification, Security & Emergency services.<br> <br>
						</p>
						<p>Without privacy life would be too risky. An individual
							would be highly vulnerable to control by others and shall lose
							freedom. An individual can be manipulated, harmed or exploited in
							absence of privacy or due to privacy breach. Hence, Privacy is
							extremely important for an individual to feel secure and free.</p>

					<p>With more and more data being collected by various
						Organizations to make the day-to-day life easier, risks to privacy
						has increased many fold. Thus, lifestyle and ease at the cost of
						Privacy has become a big question and concern.</p>
					<p>There are situations when individuals, groups and
						organizations do misuse the collected data for direct or indirect
						monetary benefits leading to breach of Privacy of others. In last
						two decades, events of such breaches have increased significantly
						which has forced Governments across geographies to define Data
						Privacy & Protection laws. These laws focus primarily on
						collection, processing and protection of data of their citizens
						within and outside the perimeters of the country. At times these
						laws also take care of non citizens data collected from other
						geographies for business purposes.</p>
					<p>There are about 80 countries in the world which have some
						kind of Data Privacy & Protection law. Following countries have
						the most comprehensive data protection law with penal provisions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Europe (General Data Protection Regulation)</li>
						<li>UK (Separate Data Protection Act likely after Brexit)</li>
						<li>Canada</li>
						<li>US</li>
						<li>Australia</li>
						<li>Russia</li>
						<li>Singapore</li>
						<li>India (Data Protection Law being drafted under the
							chairmanship of former Supreme Court Justice, Shri B N
							Srikrishna)</li>

							<p>General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) - The EU GDPR is
								the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years
								when compared to Privacy laws across the world. It replaces the
								Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (created in October 1995) and
								is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to
								protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape
								the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.</p>
							<p>After 2 years of adoption in April 2016 by Council of
								European Union, the new regulation, GDPR, will become fully
								enforceable throughout the European Union on 25 May 2018. Post
								this date, Organizations in non-compliance may face heavy fines.</p>
							<p>Key changes to the Law are:</p>

					<p>Evolution of privacy in India has taken a long way since
						1950s to be finally considered as Fundamental Right through a
						landmark judgement in August 2017.</p>
					<p>Indian judiciary and the Supreme Court in particular, have
						dealt with the issue of privacy, both as a fundamental right under
						the constitution and as a common law right. The common thread
						through all these judgments by the supreme court of India has been
						to recognize right to privacy either as a fundamental under the
						constitution or as a common law right, but to refrain from giving
						a specific definition before the recent landmark judgement.</p>
					<p>Evolvement of Right to Privacy in India is shown below:</p>
